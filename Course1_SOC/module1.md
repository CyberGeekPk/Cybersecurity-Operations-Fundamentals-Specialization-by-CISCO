# Introduction to SOC

- This course will help you acquire the fundamental skills required in a security operations center.
- You will learn the primary functions of a security operations center (SOC) and the critical role it plays in protecting organizational assets from cyber-attacks.
- Gain an understanding of SOC team member’s daily activities and responsibilities
- Identify who these bad actors are, their motives, why they attack, and what they attack
- Review the goals of implementing a SOC and covers the business benefits that an organization achieves by employing a SOC
- Introduce technical and procedural challenges in a SOC

## SOC Defined

The SOC is a centralized command center for network security event monitoring and incident response. A SOC is responsible for detecting, analyzing, and reporting unauthorized and malicious network activity by employing advanced threat-detection capabilities.

The primary function of a SOC is to provide central monitoring capabilities to detect, identify, and respond to security incidents that may impact the organization’s infrastructure, services, and customers. A SOC's fundamental objective is to detect and contain attacks and intrusions in the shortest possible time. The goal is to limit the potential impact or damage that an incident may produce by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of suspicious events. 

If a SOC can either prevent or terminate an active attack, it can inherently save an organization time, money, and possibly prevent data exfiltration. Damage to a brand's reputation may also occur, depending on the nature and extent of the attack.

Before attacks occur, in-depth analysis of network traffic has been performed to establish a baseline of normal behavior. Policies and controls can then be implemented to properly defend the environment. During an attack, it is critical to detect the presence of malware and block identified threats continuously.

After an attack, take the following actions:

- Marginalize the impact of an attack by identifying the point of entry
- Determine the scope of the attack
- Contain the threat and remediate the infected host
- Minimize the risk of re-infection

## Goal of a SOC

- A threat-centric SOC can proactively hunt for malicious threats on networks. New threats can be discovered through recently identified vulnerabilities, threat intelligence gathering services, and reported observations detailing malicious anomalies across targeted industry segments. 

- A compliance-based SOC can focus on evaluating the compliance posture of network systems to confirm they adhere to industry-recommended device configuration templates and standardized system builds. This type of compliance monitoring detects unauthorized configuration changes that reveal existing configuration problems that may lead to a security breach. 

- Operational-based SOCs are tasked with monitoring the security posture of an organization’s internal network. Tiers 2 and 3 SOC analysts in operational-based SOCs will research, develop, and operationalize complex detection techniques that are tailored for an organization’s specific network environment.
