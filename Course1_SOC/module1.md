## SOC Defined

The SOC is a centralized command center for network security event monitoring and incident response. A SOC is responsible for detecting, analyzing, and reporting unauthorized and malicious network activity by employing advanced threat-detection capabilities.

The primary function of a SOC is to provide central monitoring capabilities to detect, identify, and respond to security incidents that may impact the organization’s infrastructure, services, and customers. A SOC's fundamental objective is to detect and contain attacks and intrusions in the shortest possible time. The goal is to limit the potential impact or damage that an incident may produce by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of suspicious events. 

If a SOC can either prevent or terminate an active attack, it can inherently save an organization time, money, and possibly prevent data exfiltration. Damage to a brand's reputation may also occur, depending on the nature and extent of the attack.
