## Introduction to Developing Key Relationships with Internal and External Stakeholders

An organization must consider many factors when developing and  implementing an incident management communication plan. The organization  must clearly define and identify the specific resources and their  associated responsibilities within the plan.  

During a crisis, resources cooperate more efficiently if the  organization has an established incident management communication plan.  This plan benefits the organization during a crisis by improving its  capability to effectively respond to an incident.  
To be an effective resource to an  organization, the security operations center (SOC) must rely on both  internal and external resources, which are commonly known as  stakeholders. One step that should be included in the incident response  (IR) plan is to disclose the incident to the internal and external  stakeholders that are identified within the plan. Honest and transparent  communication is essential during an incident, because it helps foster a  trusting relationship between the SOC and the stakeholders.

Proper incident management communication also helps ensure alignment with industry standards and SOC frameworks.

You  will now learn who these stakeholders are, their responsibilities in  the context of incident response, and how they interact with the SOC.
