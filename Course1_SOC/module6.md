## Introduction to Developing Key Relationships with Internal and External Stakeholders

An organization must consider many factors when developing and  implementing an incident management communication plan. The organization  must clearly define and identify the specific resources and their  associated responsibilities within the plan.  

During a crisis, resources cooperate more efficiently if the  organization has an established incident management communication plan.  This plan benefits the organization during a crisis by improving its  capability to effectively respond to an incident.  
To be an effective resource to an  organization, the security operations center (SOC) must rely on both  internal and external resources, which are commonly known as  stakeholders. One step that should be included in the incident response  (IR) plan is to disclose the incident to the internal and external  stakeholders that are identified within the plan. Honest and transparent  communication is essential during an incident, because it helps foster a  trusting relationship between the SOC and the stakeholders.

Proper incident management communication also helps ensure alignment with industry standards and SOC frameworks.

You  will now learn who these stakeholders are, their responsibilities in  the context of incident response, and how they interact with the SOC.

## Internal Stakeholders

Although the SOC team members are highly  skilled cybersecurity professionals, they must engage personnel in the  organization’s other departments to carry out their incident response  efforts. These personnel are known as internal stakeholders. They  provide the necessary expertise and guidance during an incident  response.

Internal stakeholders range  from human resources to legal department personnel. It is important for  you to learn how to identify the internal stakeholders. It is also  important to look at their responsibilities and interactions with the  SOC team during an incident response. You will need to consider the  rules of engagement that the SOC will use when seeking their assistance.  The organization will have to define the information escalation process  that will be followed during an incident response by following the  established incident management communication plan.

- Incident Response Technical Lead
- Information Technology (Network Security Engineer)
- Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Group
- Legal Council
- Public Relations Affairs and Media Relations
- Help Desk

## External Stakeholders

An organization might be obligated to divulge information to certain  external bodies, more commonly known as external stakeholders, when a  cybersecurity incident occurs. It’s important for the organization to  build relationships and to establish effective practices for  communicating with external stakeholders. Cybercrime incidents are  always unplanned and cannot be predicted. Therefore, incident management  communication often occurs quickly and unexpectedly and the  organization must predetermine the appropriate information to share with  each external stakeholder before an incident. During the first phase of  the incident response, the organization engages with their computer  security incident response team (CSIRT). The organization assigns a  point of contact (POC) to interact with external stakeholders. The POC  and incident response team must follow the organization’s policies and  guidelines for interacting with external stakeholders. The  organization’s legal department must also be consulted before  information is shared with external stakeholders.
