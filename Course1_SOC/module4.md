# SOC Roles

The following figure presents a high-level view of the potential job  roles that are necessary for a SOC. For example, an entry-level analyst  would most likely perform initial triage for alerts that are generated  from a security information and event management tool (SIEM) or an IT  service management (ITSM) ticketing system. After determining that an  alert requires further investigation (based on the SOC’s policies and  workflow procedures), an analyst might escalate the alert to the  investigation team to analyze. The investigation team might collect data  from available tools and perform event correlation on the data to  identify any patterns or relationships. If they determine that more  analysis is necessary, they escalate the alert to a senior member of the  team.

The SOC job roles that are identified in the figure are not specifically  defined. Research indicates that SOC-related job roles and  responsibilities within organizations can vary widely. Each organization  might have responsibilities that overlap with other defined roles in a  different organization. Standards have been ineffective at solving this  issue. For example, the NIST NICE workforce framework (Publication—NIST  800-181 Rev.1) identifies the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) in  the categories of Investigate, Collect and Operate, and Analyze.  However, overlaps might occur in KSAs between the Investigate, and the  Collect and Operate categories across various organizations.
