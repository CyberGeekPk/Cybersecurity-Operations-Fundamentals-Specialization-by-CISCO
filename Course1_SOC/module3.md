## SOC Types and Staffing Considerations

### Threat-centric SOC

A threat-centric SOC proactively hunts for malicious threats on networks. New threats can be discovered through recently identified vulnerabilities, threat intelligence gathering services, and reported observations detailing malicious anomalies across targeted industry segments.

Detecting attacks and incidents is a challenging task, even for highly trained security personnel. To deal with today's greatest security challenges, organizations need a simpler, scalable, threat-centric approach that addresses security across the entire attack continuumâ€”before, during, and after an attack. 

Before an attack, comprehensive contextual awareness and in-depth analysis of the network traffic are needed to implement policies and controls that properly defend the environment.
During an attack, it is critical to have the ability to continuously detect the presence of malware and block identified threats.
After an attack, the following actions should be taken:

- Marginalize the impact of an attack by identifying the point of entry
- Determine the scope of the attack
- Contain the threat and remediate the infected host
- Minimize the risk of reinfection
