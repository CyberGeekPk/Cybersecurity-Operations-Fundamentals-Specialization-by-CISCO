## SOC Relevant Data and Security Event Data Introduction

When responding to an incident, the SOC analyst must perform an analysis  based on event data types. For instance, the event data type that is  used to display only the source and destination elements of a session  differs from the event data type that represents a full account of all  the data exchanged between two devices on the network.  

The SOC analyst must understand the  attack kill chain process to determine which data they need to examine  during the security incident.

## Network Security Monitoring Data Types

Because  no single data type offers a complete solution, the SOC analyst must  conduct the investigation by analyzing several types of event data:

- Session data
- Full packet capture
- Transaction data
- Extracted data
- Statistical data
- Alert data
- External data
