# SOC Processes & Services

- Understand primary responsibilities of a SOC and its interactions with other departments within the organization
- Understand various services that a SOC provides throughout the incident response phases

## SOC Interaction with Other Departments

All SOCs require effective tools, experienced SOC analysts with comprehensive technical backgrounds, and strong relationships with internal and external organizations. Building strong, positive relationships with important business stakeholders is direct and concise communication. The security analyst must identify important resources from IT, networking, and software or database departments when an incident occurs. You may want to create a diagram detailing the relationship of the business stakeholders with corresponding resources, including the optimum methods of communication.

## Common SOC Services

A SOC offers services that begin before incidents occur and continue to function until after the incidents are resolved. Here you will learn about the various services that a SOC provides throughout the incident response phases.

One of the main responsibilities of a SOC is to find and respond to security incidents. Incidents are alerts or events that could pose a serious threat to the organization and should be escalated to the incident response team.

The SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, and Security) Institute is the world’s largest provider of security training and certification. SANS defines a six-step plan for incident response and is widely used in the cybersecurity industry for cybersecurity incident response procedures.

The six steps of the SANS incident response plan are the following: 

- Preparation: The organization’s security policy is defined. A risk assessment is performed to identify all sensitive assets, and a strategy is then defined to prioritize security incidents based on the risk assessment. Finally, a Computer Incident Response Team (CSIRT) will be established, which is the group that works in responding to computer security incidents.

- Identification: Possible security incidents are identified in this phase. Additional evidence is collected to document the type and severity of each incident’s occurrence.

- Containment: This phase ensures that a confirmed incident does not spread or cause more damage, and that the attacker is unable to access any additional resources.

- Eradication: In this phase, all unauthorized information is completely removed from systems. An example is “bot” software that was used to communicate with a command-and-control server on the internet. If not removed, it could remain latent for a large period and therefore go undetected, only to initiate communication at a later date.

- Recovery: After the incident has been isolated and eradicated, the affected systems are restored to their “normal” state, or as close as possible to this state. 

- Lessons learned: In the last phase, determination of the cause of the incident is the focal point. A plan is developed for preventing future occurrences proactively.
