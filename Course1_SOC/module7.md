## Security Data Aggregation

A SIEM is used by most enterprises to provide real-time reporting and analysis of security events. The SIEM collects, sorts, processes, prioritizes, stores, and reports the alarms to the security analyst. One of the main goals of using a SIEM is to reduce the time that is needed to detect, and to contain the threats.

The main SIEM functions include:

- Log collection of event records from sources throughout the organization
- Log normalization to map log messages from different systems to a common data model
- Events and logs correlation to speed the detection of and reaction to security threats
- Consolidating duplicate event records to reduce the volume of event data to be analyzed
- Reporting tools to address regulation compliance reporting requirements

The SIEM is intended to be the glue for various security tools. Many Open Source and closed-source SIEMs are available in the market. Vendor-specific SIEMs, such as Splunk, may also contain some Open Source components. All the Splunk Open Source projects are hosted on GitHub.
